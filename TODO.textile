Trim of MD prefixes on all attributes returned from Spotlight.
In general will be removing kMDItem and FS.

Most FS attributes will be stripped on upload. The only exception I assume is FSSize. 
FSInvisible and FSHasCustomIcon won't be relevant when it comes to display on the website.

kMDItemContentCreationDate => content_creation_date
kMDItemContentTypeTree => content_type_tree
kMDItemKind => kind


Have a definition of the type of file.
This will be based off the kMDItemContentTypeTree value returned from Spotlight

Within the C code

Write a method to return a Hash of the attributes and their values

item = Candle.new 'path/to/file.pdf'
item.attributes => {
	:title => 'file.pdf',
	:type => 'Portable Document Format (PDF)',
	:content_type => 'pdf',
	:content_type_tree => ['composite-content','pdf'],
	:creator => 'Adobe InDesign CS3 (5.0.4)',
	:text_content => 'A newfangled day starts like any other, with a huge serve of battery hen eggs '
}

h2. Changing attributes names

We will want to change the names of the attributes, so that they are more meaningful.
Additionally so that they are ruby-like. (being underscore and separated by underscores)

attribute_name.gsub('kMDItem','').gsub('FS','').underscore

Will give us something like...
kMDItemContentModificationDate => content_modification_date


API

asset = Asset.first # uploaded file
asset.file # File information (Joint attachment proxy in our case)
asset.file.metadata 'path/to/file'
